# How to Read a Spectrogram
 
One of the primary tools in the Radio Frequency (RF) field is the spectrogram, a visual representation of frequencies as they change with time. IQEngine offers an intuitive platform to analyze these spectrograms.
 
## What is a Spectrogram?
 
A spectrogram is a 2D representation that showcases how the frequencies of a signal vary with time. On a spectrogram:
 
- One axis represents time (in IQEngine and GNU Radio it's the vertical)
- One axis represents frequency (in IQEngine and GNU Radio it's the horizontal)
- The color or intensity signifies the amplitude or strength of a particular frequency at a given time, using a colormap
 
## Interpreting the Spectrogram
 
### Color Intensity
 
For most colormaps, darker shades (dark blue using the default IQEngine colormap) indicate lower amplitudes, while brighter shades (such as yellows or reds) denote higher amplitudes. This means a bright streak on the spectrogram indicates a strong frequency component at that particular time. You can adjust the maximum color mapping magnitudes when viewing samples using the scrollbar:

This scrollbar determines how the magnitudes of the FFTs map to color, and allows adjustment of the dynamic range.

### Frequency Patterns
 
Thin straight lines represent always-on tones over time, often indicating a continuous tone or narrow signal.
Thick straight lines are usually digitally modulated signals which are common in modern wireless communication systems.
Wavy or curved lines can signify frequency-modulated analog signals like FM radio.
Signals may be always on (e.g., cellular downlinks), or they may turn on and off over time (e.g., Wi-Fi or any packet-based comms).
 
### Time Evolution
 
Watching how colors change vertically can give insights into how the signal's strength varies with time.
You may be receiving a signal that is always on, but the signal strength at the receiver varies as the receiver (or transmitter) moves.
 
## Adjusting the Spectrogram

With IQEngine, you can:
 
- **Zoom In**: Lower the FFT size to zoom in, as it reduces the number of samples per row of the spectrogram, stretching it out.
- **Zoom Out**: Either increase the FFT size or use the zoom slider, the latter of which simply shows you 1 out of every N FFT's worth of samples.
- **Annotations**: View SigMF annotations and other metadata directly on the spectrogram for enhanced insights, and even edit them!
- **Plugin Integration**: Enhance your analysis with plugins written in Python, GNU Radio, or whatever language you want as long as you follow IQEngine's OpenAPI spec.
